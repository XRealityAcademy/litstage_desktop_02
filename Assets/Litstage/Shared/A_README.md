About the Shared Folder

Put your finished work here when it’s ready for review or testing by the team.
If you’re still testing or want others to try something out, you can also use Shared for those resources.
Only leads or integrators will move things from Shared to the final Production folders after approval.

In short:
	•	Use Shared for work that needs review or more testing.
	•	Shared is not for final assets or code.
